As of this version, Color Suite will generate a default color config using Tailwind's color palette. Previously, no colors were included out of the box and designers were left to build their palette from nothing on their own.

Now you can benefit from the expert work that went in to crafting Tailwind's color palette as well as the flexibility Color Suite gives you to tweak until your heart's content. Using the Tailwind palette as a foundation, it is easier than ever to build out a full palette that's harmonious with your brand colors.

### Added
- Added utility for curve-fitting a color scale group from Tailwind

### Changed
- Default color config now includes a palette generated from Tailwind's defaults

## [0.4.1] - 2022-04-13

### Added
- Added metadata to `package.json` to better link this project's relevant URLs

### Fixed
- Fixed missing `bin` directory in `files` property of `package.json` which causes NPM to throw an error

## [0.4.0] - 2022-04-09

### Added
- Add testing for Tailwind

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Replace `configureColors` function with `tailwindColors` function that only takes a Color Suite config object and returns the tailwind equivalent. It moves the require of the `colors.config.js` file into the tailwind config file
  - This approach allows Tailwind to track the `colors.config.js` file as a dependency with its JIT engine which means no more full page refresh when making CRUD changes to the color palette ðŸŽ‰
- Made package dependency-free by establishing proper peer dependencies and bundling all application dependencies into the build
- Target a minimum version of Tailwind CSS v3

### Fixed
- Prevent error when updating root variables after hot update by maintaining our own stylesheet

## [0.3.1] - 2021-10-12

### Added
- Add setting for adding CSS `inherit` value to palette

### Changed
- Patch root variables directly using stylesheet rather than polluting the HTML element

### Fixed
- Don't join current working directory to config path if the passed config path is absolute.
